# Creating a Block Entity
A block/tile entity is a type of block that you can use when your block needs to store/save special data beyond the 16 metadata values possible with a normal block. This guide will go over how to make a simple crate storage block.

> You can optionally use [this crate texture](/assets/crate.png) created by Tyy on Modification Station for the tutorial.
